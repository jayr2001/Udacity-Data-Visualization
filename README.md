# Udacity-Data-Visualization

This is my third project in the data analyst nanodegree under the scholarship of ALX in partnership with Udacity. The project basically entails exploratory and explanatory data visualization, from univariate, bivariate to multivariate visualization techniques.
The project is divided into two parts. The first part entails exploratory visualizations which are necessary for deeper understanding of the variables in the data set. In the second part, i created a presentation slide that comprise of polished exlanatory visualizations for telling stories about my data. Alongside is also a readme file which contains key findings from exploratory phase as well as key insights for the presentation.
